I develop web applications, starting with the minimum viable product (MVP), consistently improving it in accordance with actual requirements. I use a test-driven development approach (TDD) and follow continuous integration and delivery principles (CI/CD).
  Stack:
    Front-end: HTML (HAML, ERB), CSS (SASS), JavaScript (react.js)
    Back-end: Ruby, Ruby on Rails, RSpec (for testing)
    Database layer: PostgreSQL
